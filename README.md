# Clay #
Clay is a replacement OS for Kobo Touch.

## Installing ##
Right now I haven't had time to create an installer. This means that in order to run
Clay, you'll need to gain telnet access to your Touch. Instructions for this are
available [at the MobileRead website](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kobo_Touch_Hacking).

You'll also need the 1.7.0 Kobo JRE from the downloads section of this repository.

## Disclaimer ##
This is an *experimental* OS, and it takes a bit of skill to install it. Don't install
Clay unless you've backed up your Kobo's boot partition, and are prepared to purchase
a new one. Also, due to its experimental nature, it may mess up your system, but that's very unlikely due to its high-level design. Still, I'm not responsible if you brick your Kobo.
