# Clay #
Clay is a replacement OS for Kobo Touch.

## Installing ##
Right now I haven't had time to create an installer. This means that in order to run
Clay, you'll need to gain telnet access to your Touch. Instructions for this are
available [at the MobileRead website](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kobo_Touch_Hacking).

You'll also need the 1.7.0 Kobo JRE from the downloads section of this repository.
