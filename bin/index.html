		<h1 align="center">Welcome to Clay!</h1>
		<p>Clay is an OS intended to replace the <b>Kobo's</b> default
			system. While <tt>nickel</tt> is pretty great, there are a
			few things it does not support.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To-do lists</li>
			<li>Calendar</li>
			<li>Email</li>
			<li>Advanced WPA2 authentication</li>
			<li>Custom screensavers</li>
			<li>And more...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There's no reason why the device should not be capable of doing
		these things... and in fact it is capable! I'm just unlocking these
		capabilities so everyone can take advantage of them. </p>
